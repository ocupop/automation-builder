# Kubernetes Deployment with GKE and Terraform

This configuration demonstrates how Kubernetes fits into the container deployment strategy. Here's how Kubernetes differs from the previous Cloud Run and ECS approaches:

## Key Differences from Serverless Solutions

1. **Control and Flexibility**
   - Full control over the Kubernetes cluster
   - Ability to run any type of workload (not just HTTP services)
   - Custom networking and security policies
   - Support for stateful applications

2. **Resource Management**
   - Fine-grained control over resource allocation
   - Node pool management
   - Auto-scaling at both pod and node level
   - Resource quotas and limits

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Service mesh integration
   - Custom schedulers
   - DaemonSets and StatefulSets
   - Persistent volume management
   - Ingress controllers

## When to Choose Kubernetes

Choose Kubernetes when you need:

1. **Complex Deployments**
   - Multiple interconnected services
   - Stateful applications
   - Custom networking requirements
   - Specific hardware requirements

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - High-density deployments
   - Custom scheduling rules
   - Resource sharing between applications

3. **Advanced Orchestration**
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Canary releases
   - Complex routing rules
   - Custom health checks

4. **Multi-Cloud Strategy**
   - Consistent deployment across clouds
   - Hybrid cloud setups
   - Cloud provider independence

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install `kubectl`
   - Install Google Cloud SDK
   - Configure GCP authentication

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Configure Variables**
   Edit `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```hcl
   project_id      = "your-project-id"
   cluster_name    = "your-cluster-name"
   region          = "us-west1"
   app_name        = "your-app"
   container_image = "gcr.io/your-project/your-image:tag"
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Access Cluster**
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials your-cluster-name --region us-west1
   ```

## Infrastructure Components

1. **VPC Network**
   - Custom VPC network
   - Subnet with secondary IP ranges
   - Network policies

2. **GKE Cluster**
   - Regional cluster for high availability
   - Workload identity for security
   - Custom node pools
   - Auto-scaling configuration

3. **Kubernetes Resources**
   - Deployment with replicas
   - Service for load balancing
   - Resource requests and limits
   - Environment variables

## Monitoring and Management

1. **Cluster Monitoring**
   - Cloud Monitoring integration
   - Kubernetes Dashboard
   - Stackdriver logging
   - Custom metrics

2. **Application Monitoring**
   - Pod metrics
   - Container logs
   - Service health checks
   - Custom prometheus metrics

## Cost Considerations

Kubernetes clusters have different cost factors:
- Node instance costs
- Persistent storage
- Load balancer costs
- Network egress
- Cluster management fee

## Security Best Practices

1. **Cluster Security**
   - Private GKE clusters
   - Node auto-upgrades
   - Network policies
   - Workload identity

2. **Application Security**
   - Pod security policies
   - RBAC configuration
   - Secret management
   - Container vulnerability scanning

## Scaling Strategies

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**
   - CPU/Memory based
   - Custom metrics
   - External metrics

2. **Cluster Autoscaling**
   - Node pool autoscaling
   - Node pool upgrades
   - Preemptible nodes

## Common Use Cases

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing
   - Circuit breaking
   - API gateway

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Job scheduling
   - CronJobs
   - Queue workers
   - Parallel processing

3. **Stateful Applications**
   - Databases
   - Message queues
   - Caching systems
   - File storage

## Troubleshooting

1. **Cluster Issues**
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl describe node [node-name]
   ```

2. **Application Issues**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl logs [pod-name]
   kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
   ```

3. **Networking Issues**
   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   kubectl get endpoints
   ```
